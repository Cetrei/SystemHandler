## Utility
if you use combat systems, levels, vehicles, etc., which are from different creators, you may encounter issues with incompatibility or bad practices by developers who do not handle possible errors with promises or pcalls and do not guarantee the existence of certain objects.

CGD System Handler allows you to manage all your systems in one place so you can easily add, remove, activate, or deactivate them, and it executes them safely, preventing performance issues.

## Advantages
- Easy to use: With the official plugin, you can use all the system functions without knowing how to program.   Additionally, the documentation includes tutorials for adding systems like ACS.
- Cross-game config: You can share the settings you make to certain systems across all your games.
- Safe execution: This module uses various methods to handle errors that may occur in the systems and is capable of deactivating them to avoid severe problems.
